## What we'll be building
For this course, we'll be building a simplified version of the financial dashboard that has:

* A public home page.
* A login page.
* Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
* The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.
The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which you'll set up in a later chapter.

By the end of the course, you'll have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.
